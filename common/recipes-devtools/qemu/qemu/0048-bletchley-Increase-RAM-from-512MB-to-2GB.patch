Subject: [PATCH] bletchley: Increase RAM from 512MB to 2GB

Quanta is experimenting with switching Bletchley from 512MB of DRAM to
2GB. The device tree has been updated, so this updates QEMU.

You may or may not need the kernel arg `vmalloc=384M` to boot
successfully with this, because the default kernel memory allocation
seems to decrease and cause a kernel panic.
