The BMC shall display firmware version for all System and auxiliary CPLDs.  
Also, the BMC shall show versions of firmware which will be activated on the
next reboot to ensure any firmware updates which may be pending can be detected
by data center tooling.  The BMC shall report the CPLD version information
via the fw-util command and via the Redfish interface.
