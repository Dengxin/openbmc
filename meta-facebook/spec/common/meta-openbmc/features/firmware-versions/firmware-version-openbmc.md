The BMC shall read firmware versions for the BMC (ROM and BMC versions).  
Also, the BMC shall show versions of firmware which will be activated
on the next reboot to ensure any firmware updates which may be pending
can be detected by data center tooling.  The BMC shall report the BMC
version information via the fw-util command and via the Redfish interface.
