The BMC shall display the version for the System BIOS.  Also, the BMC shall
show versions of system BIOS which will be activated on the next reboot to
ensure any firmware updates which may be pending can be detected by data
center tooling.  The BMC shall report the system BIOS version information
via the fw-util command and via the Redfish interface.
