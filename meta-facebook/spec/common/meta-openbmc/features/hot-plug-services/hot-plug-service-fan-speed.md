The BMC shall ensure when any slot or NIC is removed from the chassis, the fan
speed is to go to 100%.  Fan speed may need to increment at intervals to
prevent power issues with the chassis.  When the slot is inserted back or a
NIC card re-inserted, the fan service should be reinitialized to ensure the
fan configuration file (fsc-configuration.json) is updated.
